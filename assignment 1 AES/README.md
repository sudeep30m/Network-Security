# Advanced Encryption Scheme

Implemented a 128 bit key 10 round AES symmetric key cryptosystem in JavaScript. No external modules have been used. To run the code, enter the following command - 


```
cd src
node core.js
```

The file **core.js** contains both the inputs for plaintext and key as hex strings.
